    <function id="NET_WRITE" name="Allow Network Write Attribute" returnType="EmberAfAttributeWritePermission">
      <description>
        This function is called by the application framework before it writes an attribute in response to a write attribute request from an external device. The value passed into this callback is the value to which the attribute is to be set by the framework.
        Example:	In mirroring simple metering data on an Energy Services Interface (ESI) (formerly called Energy Service Portal (ESP) in SE 1.0).), a mirrored simple meter needs to write read-only attributes on its mirror. The-meter-mirror sample application, located in app/framework/sample-apps, uses this callback to allow the mirrored device to write simple metering attributes on the mirror regardless of the fact that most simple metering attributes are defined as read-only by the ZigBee specification.
        Note:	The ZCL specification does not (as of this writing) specify any permission-level security for writing writeable attributes. As far as the ZCL specification is concerned, if an attribute is writeable, any device that has a link key for the device should be able to write that attribute. Furthermore if an attribute is read only, it should not be written over the air. Thus, if you implement permissions for writing attributes as a feature, you MAY be operating outside the specification. This is unlikely to be a problem for writing read-only attributes, but it may be a problem for attributes that are writeable according to the specification but restricted by the application implementing this callback.

      <description>
        This callback is the first in the Application Framework’s message processing chain. The Application Framework calls it when a message has been received over the air but has not yet been parsed by the ZCL command-handling code. If you wish to parse some messages that are completely outside the ZCL specification or are not handled by the Application Framework’s command handling code, you should intercept them for parsing in this callback. 
        This callback returns a Boolean value indicating whether or not the message has been handled. If the callback returns a value of TRUE, then the Application Framework assumes that the message has been handled and it does nothing else with it. If the callback returns a value of FALSE, then the application framework continues to process the message as it would with any incoming message.
        Note: 	This callback receives a pointer to an incoming message struct. This struct allows the application framework to provide a unified interface between both Host devices, which receive their message through the ezspIncomingMessageHandler, and SoC devices, which receive their message through emberIncomingMessageHandler.

        This callback is the second in the Application Framework’s message processing chain. At this point in the processing of incoming over-the-air messages, the application has determined that the incoming message is a ZCL command. It parses enough of the message to populate an EmberAfClusterCommand struct. The Application Framework defines this struct value in a local scope to the command processing but also makes it available through a global pointer called emberAfCurrentCommand, in app/framework/util/util.c. When command processing is complete, this pointer is cleared.

        Note: No callback in the Application Framework is associated with resource cleanup. If you are implementing your application on a Unix host where resource cleanup is a consideration, we expect that you will use the standard Posix system calls, including the use of atexit() and handlers for signals such as SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGCHLD, SIGPIPE and so on. If you use the signal() function to register your signal handler, please mind the returned value which may be an Application Framework function. If the return value is non-null, please make sure that you call the returned function from your handler to avoid negating the resource cleanup of the Application Framework itself.

      <description>
        This function is called whenever the Application Framework needs to write an attribute which is not stored within the data structures of the Application Framework itself. One of the new features in Version 2 is the ability to store attributes outside the Framework. This is particularly useful for attributes that do not need to be stored because they can be read off the hardware when they are needed, or are stored in some central location used by many modules within the system. In this case, you can indicate that the attribute is stored externally. When the framework needs to write an external attribute, it makes a call to this callback.
        This callback is very useful for host micros which need to store attributes in persistent memory. Because each host micro (used with an Ember NCP like the EM260) has its own type of persistent memory storage, the Application Framework does not include the ability to mark attributes as stored in flash the way that it does for Ember SoCs like the EM35x. On a host micro, any attributes that need to be stored in persistent memory should be marked as external and accessed through the external read and write callbacks. Any host code associated with the persistent storage should be implemented within this callback.
        All of the important information about the attribute itself is passed as a pointer to an EmberAfAttributeMetadata struct, which is stored within the application and used to manage the attribute. A complete description of the EmberAfAttributeMetadata struct is provided in app/framework/include/af-types.h.
        This function assumes that the application is able to write the attribute and return immediately. Any attributes that require a state machine for reading and writing are not candidates for externalization at the present time. The Application Framework does not currently include a state machine for reading or writing attributes that must take place across a series of application ticks. Attributes that cannot be written immediately should be stored within the Application Framework and updated occasionally by the application code from within the emberAfMainTickCallback.
        If the application was successfully able to write the attribute, it returns a value of EMBER_ZCL_STATUS_SUCCESS. Any other return value indicates the application was not able to write the attribute.

Attributes that cannot be read in a timely manner should be stored within the Application Framework and updated occasionally by the application code from within the emberAfMainTickCallback.
        If the application was successfully able to read the attribute and write it into the passed buffer, it should return a value of EMBER_ZCL_STATUS_SUCCESS. Any other return value indicates the application was not able to read the attribute.

      <description>
        This callback should be implemented, if the device has access to real time clock, and has an ability to update that clock. The application framework expects to be passed the utcTime which is the number of seconds since the year 2000. Default implementation does nothing. Note: This function used to take time in year, month, day, hour, min, sec. We have changed this to utcTime in order to conserve code space.
