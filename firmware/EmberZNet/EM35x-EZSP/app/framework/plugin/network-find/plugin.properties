# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of routines for finding and joining any viable network via scanning, rather than joining a specific network. If you are planning to deploy your application in an environment where there are potentially lots of open networks you may whish to implement a mechanism for network blacklisting. Network blacklisting may be accomplished by implementing the emberAfPluginNetworkFindJoinCallback.

options=channelMask,radioTxPower,radioTxCallback,extendedPanId,duration,joinableScanTimeoutMinutes

channelMask.name=Channel mask
channelMask.description=The channels that the plugin will scan when forming and joining.
channelMask.type=CHANNELS
channelMask.default=0x0318C800UL

radioTxPower.name=Radio output power
radioTxPower.description=The radio output power (in dBm) at which the node will operate.
radioTxPower.type=POWER
radioTxPower.default=3

radioTxCallback.name=Get radio output power from callback
radioTxCallback.description=Use a tx power callback to determine radio tx power.
radioTxCallback.type=BOOLEAN
radioTxCallback.default=false

extendedPanId.name=Extended PAN ID
extendedPanId.description=The extended PAN ID to use when forming or joining networks.  If the extended PAN ID is set to all zeros, a random value will be used when forming and any network will be considered when joining.
extendedPanId.type=EUI64
extendedPanId.default=00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

duration.name=Scan duration exponent
duration.description=The exponent of the number of scan periods, where a scan period is 960 symbols, and a symbol is 16 miscroseconds.  The scan will occur for ((2^duration) + 1) scan periods.
duration.type=NUMBER:0,14
duration.default=5

joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.name=Joinable scan timeout (minutes)
joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.description=The amount of time (in minutes) that the plugin will wait during a joinable network scan for the application to determine if the network joined to by the plugin is correct.  If the application leaves the network during this time, the plugin will automatically continue searching for other joinable networks.  If set to zero, the application will be unable to resume a joinable network search after successfully joining to a network.
joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.type=NUMBER:0,5
joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.default=1

events=tick
