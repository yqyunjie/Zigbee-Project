linkInitiator.name=Link initiator
linkInitiator.description=Indicates whether this device is capable of initiating the touch link procedure.  The initiator components of touch linking are disabled in the plugin and the device will only be permitted to act as a target if this option is not set.
linkInitiator.type=BOOLEAN
linkInitiator.default=TRUE

touchLinkSecondsDelay.name=Touch link delay time (in seconds)
touchLinkSecondsDelay.description=The amount of time, in seconds, the plugin will wait before sending a network form or start to a target device.  The user may abort the touch link procedure during this delay if, for example, the wrong target device has been selected.
touchLinkSecondsDelay.type=NUMBER:1,255
touchLinkSecondsDelay.default=3
touchLinkSecondsDelay.dependsOn=linkInitiator

subDeviceTableSize.name=Sub-device table size
subDeviceTableSize.description=The maximum number of sub-devices discovered on remote nodes.  The plugin will attempt to retrieve device information records from each sub-device on the remote node during touch linking, up to this limit.
subDeviceTableSize.type=NUMBER:1,255
subDeviceTableSize.default=1
subDeviceTableSize.dependsOn=linkInitiator

groupAddresses.name=Group addresses
groupAddresses.description=The number of unique group identifiers that this device requires.
groupAddresses.type=NUMBER:0,255
groupAddresses.default=0
groupAddresses.define=EMBER_ZLL_GROUP_ADDRESSES

rssiThreshold.name=RSSI threshold
rssiThreshold.description=The RSSI threshold applied to incoming scan requests.  The stack will ignore scan requests with corrected RSSI values less than this threshold.
rssiThreshold.type=NUMBER:-128,127
rssiThreshold.default=-128
rssiThreshold.define=EMBER_ZLL_RSSI_THRESHOLD

scanPowerLevel.name=Scan Power Level
scanPowerLevel.description=The power level used to transmit the scan request messages by the initiator device during touch linking.  The ZLL specification requires a nominal output power of 0dBm during touch linking.
scanPowerLevel.type=POWER
scanPowerLevel.default=0
scanPowerLevel.dependsOn=linkInitiator

radioTxPower.name=Radio output power
radioTxPower.description=The radio output power (in dBm) at which the node will operate.
radioTxPower.type=POWER
radioTxPower.default=3

extendedPanId.name=Extended PAN ID
extendedPanId.description=The extended PAN ID to use when forming or joining networks.  If the extended PAN ID is set to all zeros, a random value will be used when forming and any network will be considered when joining.
extendedPanId.type=EUI64
extendedPanId.default=00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

primaryChannelMask.name=Primary channel mask
primaryChannelMask.description=The primary channel set is used in preference for commissioning and normal operations.  The plugin will always scan the primary channel set during touch linking or when searching for joinable, non-ZLL networks.  The ZLL specification defines the primary channel set as consisting of channels 11, 15, 20 and 25
primaryChannelMask.type=CHANNELS
primaryChannelMask.default=0x02108800UL

scanSecondaryChannels.name=Scan secondary channels
scanSecondaryChannels.description=ZLL networks are generally confined to the primary channel set as defined by the ZLL specification (i.e., 11, 15, 20, and 25).  The plugin will always scan the primary channel set during touch linking or when searching for joinable, non-ZLL networks.  With this option enabled, the plugin will also scan the secondary channel set (i.e., 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 26) if the device is operating on a non-ZLL network and performs a touch link or if no networks are found on the primary channels when searching for joinable, non-ZLL networks.  The ZLL specification requires that devices scan the secondary channels in these situations.  This option will increase the scanning time but will potentially find more devices or networks.
scanSecondaryChannels.type=BOOLEAN
scanSecondaryChannels.default=TRUE

secondaryChannelMask.name=Secondary channel mask
secondaryChannelMask.description=The secondary channel set is used as a backup to allow ZLL devices to better interoperate with non-ZLL networks.  If enabled, the plugin will also scan the secondary channel set if the device is operating on a non-ZLL network and performs a touch link or if no networks are found on the primary channels when searching for joinable, non-ZLL networks.  The ZLL specification defines the secondary channel set as consisting of 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 26.
secondaryChannelMask.type=CHANNELS
secondaryChannelMask.default=0x05EF7000UL
secondaryChannelMask.dependsOn=scanSecondaryChannels

joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.name=Joinable scan timeout (minutes)
joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.description=The amount of time (in minutes) that the plugin will wait during a joinable network scan for the application to determine if the network joined to by the plugin is correct.  If the application leaves the network during this time, the plugin will automatically continue searching for other joinable networks.  If set to zero, the application will be unable to resume a joinable network search after successfully joining to a network.
joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.type=NUMBER:0,5
joinableScanTimeoutMinutes.default=1

events=touchLink,network
